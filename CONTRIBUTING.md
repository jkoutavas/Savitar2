## How to contribute to Savitar

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jkoutavas/Savitar2/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/jkoutavas/Savitar2/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in [Savitar Discussions](https://github.com/jkoutavas/Savitar2/discussions) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about that, contact us via [Savitar Discussions](https://github.com/jkoutavas/Savitar2/discussions).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
